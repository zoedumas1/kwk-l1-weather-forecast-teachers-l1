# Weather Report

![](http://www.spanishprograms.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/weather.jpg)


Today, you're using data from [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/) to build out a weather report app! They're giving you awesome weather data in a hash that looks something like this: 

```ruby
{
	:city => "New York",
	:description => "Partly Cloudy",
	:temperature_farenheit => 66.3,
	:temperature_celcius => 19.1
}

``` 
## Instructions

This lab is test driven — write your code in the `weather.rb` file. Using the comments and tests as a guide,  write methods that take in a weather hash as an argument and return the desired values.
